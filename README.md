# Basic CV made with HTML and CSS
This is a basic CV template, written in HTML and CSS. Feel free to use with credit! Will probably update as I tweak it to look more professional.

### Preview (A4- code to force the contents into A4 size are commented out by default)
<img width="834" height="906" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-30 185833" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e61cbafc-a652-4402-b5f9-3e2185c56615" />

### Things to improve:
- Make it printer friendly: I've added a commented out bit of code that sets the dimensions to A4, but to make it print well, the collapsable sections will need to be removed, and a solution to make sections that run on longer than a page look nice.
- Add icons for the Contact Details section for email, Linkedin etc.
